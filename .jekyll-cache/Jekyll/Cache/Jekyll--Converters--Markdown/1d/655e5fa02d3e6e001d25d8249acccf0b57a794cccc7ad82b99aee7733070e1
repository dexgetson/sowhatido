I"<p>Where does the name of the site come from? 
The name of the site comes from a saying I didnâ€™t realize I said all that much. My partner brought it up once indicating that I always say it right before I correct someone. It is a blessing and a curse. I have a very good attention to detail and that is where this saying is a blessing in the way that I use it to improve a process or action that is being perfomred. It is a curse in the way that I am always using it to correct or change the way people do things.</p>
